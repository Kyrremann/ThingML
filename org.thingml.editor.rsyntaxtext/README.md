Things to do
------------
* Auto-save
* Close tab by clicking on 'x' in the tab
* Search/replace
* Project file - .project for each project. Need to be in one folder to seperate project from each other. Should also be editable inside the editor in a small dialog so that they can set the config file, arduino folder and maybe something else?
