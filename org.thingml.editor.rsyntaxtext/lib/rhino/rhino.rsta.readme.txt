The Rhino jar used by this library, js-14_Patch_716562.jar, is simply the
standard js-14.jar, built with the patch for issue 716562.  This bug caused
problems an infinite loop for some constructs for folks using Rhino with the
"IDE mode" option enabled (which RSTALanguageSupport does).  For more
information about the fix, see here:

https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/commit/31236c9f05e231577f0eca8217b4965592636618

Rather than use a nightly build, we decided to go with a patched version of
1.7R3, since it would theoretically be more stable.  Whenever a new stable
build of Rhino materializes (1.8?), this library will be upgraded to use that.
